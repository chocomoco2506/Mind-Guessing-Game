Designed and developed an interactive Character Guessing Game using Python, incorporating Markov Chain Algorithm and Fuzzy Logic to predict and analyze user inputs. The game intelligently guesses the character or object the audience is thinking of, providing an engaging and challenging experience. Independently sourced and curated datasets to train the system, ensuring accurate and dynamic predictions. This project strengthened my skills in algorithm implementation, data handling, and creative problem-solving.
